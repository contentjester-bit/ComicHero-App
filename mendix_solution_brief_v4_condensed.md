# PAGE 1: Introduction & The Challenge

## Subtitle (unchanged)
**A Solution Brief for CIOs and Architects**

## Opening Statement (condensed)
**Original (51 words):**
> Application Development and Integration go hand in hand, but they can also be viewed as distinct disciplines with their own skill sets and tooling. Mendix has strong integration capabilities, but for enterprise-wide integration, there is a case to be made for a separate integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS), such as the Gartner Leader Workato.

**Revised (38 words):**
> Application development and integration are complementary disciplines—each with distinct skills and tooling. While Mendix offers strong integration capabilities, enterprise-wide integration benefits from a dedicated iPaaS. Workato, a Gartner iPaaS Leader, provides this specialized layer.

## The Challenge (condensed)

**Original (147 words):**
> You bought Mendix – or you are in the process of buying it – to build enterprise-grade applications at speed and scale. Most of these applications will have to integrate with one or more backend systems, such as ERP, CRM, PLM, MES, HR, Marketing Automation, IT Service Management, Finance, Collaboration tools, RPA tools, Data Stores like Snowflake and Databricks and so on. You can build point-to-point integrations from any Mendix app to any of these backends, but, as the number of apps and backends grows, the number of integrations grows even faster. Integration can become a bottleneck for app development and, even if you do manage to build them all, you end up with a "spaghetti architecture", as shown in figure 1 below.

**Revised (87 words):**
> You invested in Mendix to build enterprise applications at speed and scale. These applications must integrate with backend systems—ERP, CRM, HR, Finance, Data Stores, and more.
>
> **The problem:** Point-to-point integrations multiply exponentially as apps and backends grow. This creates:
> - **Integration bottlenecks** that slow app development
> - **"Spaghetti architecture"** that's costly to maintain
> - **Technical debt** consuming resources meant for innovation
>
> *See Figure 1*

# PAGE 3: The Solution (condensed)

**Original (178 words):**
> To avoid this "spaghetti architecture" – or to rectify it – you can introduce a separate integration layer in between the Mendix applications and the backend systems. That way, each app and backend only has to connect with the integration layer, which then handles all the communication with the backends.
>
> You can build such an integration layer in Mendix – and there are customers who have done this – but unless you have very specific requirements, you can also buy an off-the-shelf integration layer. This category has gone by various names over the years, but Gartner now refers to it as integration Platform-as-a-Service (iPaaS) and considers Workato a leader in this space.
>
> There is an elegance to combining application development and integration in a single platform, and that is no doubt why some Mendix customers choose to do it. However, in many organisations, they are seen as separate disciplines, each with their own team of specialists. In this case, there is something to be said for giving each team its own dedicated and purpose-built platform. Moreover, an off-the-shelf iPaaS could also be used for integrations between the backends themselves, i.e. where Mendix is not needed, whereas a Mendix-based platform may only be used for Mendix-centric integrations.

**Revised (98 words):**
> **The fix:** Introduce a dedicated integration layer between Mendix applications and backend systems. Each app and backend connects once to this layer—eliminating spaghetti complexity.
>
> **Two approaches:**
>
> | Build in Mendix | Buy iPaaS (Workato) |
> |-----------------|---------------------|
> | Custom control | Purpose-built for integration |
> | Mendix-centric only | Enterprise-wide coverage |
> | Requires dev resources | 1,200+ pre-built connectors |
>
> **Why separate platforms make sense:**
> - App dev and integration are distinct disciplines with specialized teams
> - iPaaS handles backend-to-backend integrations where Mendix isn't needed
> - Workato is a 7x Gartner iPaaS Magic Quadrant Leader
>

## Conclusion (condensed)

**Original (78 words):**
> If you're building enterprise-grade applications at speed and scale, you should consider whether to build or buy a separate integration layer to avoid the complexity of a "spaghetti architecture" with too many point-to-point integrations. Unless you have very specific requirements, it probably makes sense to buy a best-of-breed integration platform, like Workato. This will boost productivity and lower TCO, not just for your integration team, but for your application development team as well. If you want to explore this further, please reach out to Maarten de Vries via your regular Mendix contacts.

**Revised (52 words):**
> Building enterprise applications at scale? Avoid spaghetti architecture with a best-of-breed iPaaS.
>
> **Workato delivers:**
> - ↑ Productivity for both integration and Mendix teams
> - ↓ TCO across integration lifecycle
> - Enterprise-wide coverage beyond Mendix-centric use cases
